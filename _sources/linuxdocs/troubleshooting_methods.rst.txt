Troubleshooting Methods
########################

I have working on electronic and linux systems for about 20 years now.  I don't
and never will claim to be an expert on anything due to the field being in 
constant flux, but I have gotten "decent" at troubleshooting in general.  I have
always had trouble seeing things in my minds eye [#f1]_ which leads to overall
memory issues, but allows me to not get lost in the details. When you are lost
in the details, you are not taking the essential step back to look at the bigger
picture needed for troubleshooting a system. And when it comes to electonics or
technology in general, that larger picture is the communication path.

The communications path at its source is a flow of electrons. When working on 
electronic systems in the army, that ment breaking out the oscope and placing a
probe into different test points along the path of electron flow to see if 
everything before the probe is working as intended.  The same can be done with 
most technology in general.  Instead of tracing the path of electrons with an 
oscope or voltmeter, we are are using many tools and logs to "probe" points
along the path.  This allows us to see if its working up to that point or not. 

The essense of troubleshooting most systems is knowing the communication path 
and ruling out sections of the path by "probing" a point along it.  So how do
you know where to probe?  I usually go by one of two methods depending on how
much I know the system's communication path. If you know the system, a
binary searchy [#f2]_ is a good way to quickly get to the root of the issue. If
you do not know the system, start from the beginning and follow the 
communication path.
